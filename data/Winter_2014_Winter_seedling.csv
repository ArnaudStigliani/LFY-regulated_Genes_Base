BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus.;"BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1); FUNCTIONS IN: in 6 functions; INVOLVED IN: in 9 processes; LOCATED IN: endosome, plasma membrane, protein complex; EXPRESSED IN: 24 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 13 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Protein kinase, ATP binding site (InterPro:IPR017441), Protein kinase, catalytic domain (InterPro:IPR000719), Leucine-rich repeat-containing N-terminal domain, type 2 (InterPro:IPR013210), Leucine-rich repeat (InterPro:IPR001611), Serine/threonine-protein kinase-like domain (InterPro:IPR017442), Protein kinase-like domain (InterPro:IPR011009), Serine/threonine-protein kinase, active site (InterPro:IPR008271); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: BRI1 like (TAIR:AT1G55610.2); Has 214988 Blast hits to 139206 proteins in 4645 species: Archae - 193; Bacteria - 21464; Metazoa - 65624; Fungi - 10774; Plants - 90532; Viruses - 410; Other Eukaryotes - 25991 (source: NCBI BLink).";18321286;+;Parallel;Y138;Unassigned (Convergent);98;Exon;chr4;na;na;na;na;2433648;+;Convergent;Convergent139;AT1G30360;257;Exon;chr1;protein_coding;Early-responsive to dehydration stress protein (ERD4);;"early-responsive to dehydration 4 (ERD4); INVOLVED IN: response to water deprivation; LOCATED IN: plasma membrane, chloroplast, vacuole, membrane, chloroplast envelope; EXPRESSED IN: 26 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 14 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Protein of unknown function DUF221 (InterPro:IPR003864); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: ERD (early-responsive to dehydration stress) family protein (TAIR:AT4G02900.1); Has 1361 Blast hits to 1266 proteins in 197 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 0; Metazoa - 183; Fungi - 651; Plants - 396; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 131 (source: NCBI BLink).";10715922;+;na;Y140;AT5G42750;-221;<1.5kb upstream;chr5;protein_coding;BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1;Encodes a plasma-membrane associated phosphoprotein that interacts directly with the kinase domain of BRI1.

The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium.

It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.  The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots.;"myb domain protein 12 (MYB12); CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: SANT, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR001005), Homeodomain-like (InterPro:IPR009057), Myb, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR014778), HTH transcriptional regulator, Myb-type, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR017930), Homeodomain-related (InterPro:IPR012287), Myb transcription factor (InterPro:IPR015495); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: myb domain protein 11 (TAIR:AT3G62610.1); Has 8833 Blast hits to 8133 proteins in 470 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 0; Metazoa - 786; Fungi - 423; Plants - 5965; Viruses - 6; Other Eukaryotes - 1653 (source: NCBI BLink).";19477261;+;na;Y938;AT1G28281;40;Exon;chr1;protein_coding;;;"unknown protein; LOCATED IN: endomembrane system; Has 30201 Blast hits to 17322 proteins in 780 species: Archae - 12; Bacteria - 1396; Metazoa - 17338; Fungi - 3422; Plants - 5037; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 2996 (source: NCBI BLink).";9887559;+;na;N939;Unassigned (Convergent);62;Exon;chr5;na;na;na;na;21562322;+;Convergent;Convergent940;AT3G19540;-1550;<3kb upstream;chr3;protein_coding;Protein of unknown function (DUF620);;"Protein of unknown function (DUF620); FUNCTIONS IN: molecular_function unknown; INVOLVED IN: biological_process unknown; LOCATED IN: plasma membrane; EXPRESSED IN: 21 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 13 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Protein of unknown function DUF620 (InterPro:IPR006873); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: Protein of unknown function (DUF620) (TAIR:AT1G49840.1); Has 219 Blast hits to 218 proteins in 2 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 0; Metazoa - 0; Fungi - 0; Plants - 219; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 0 (source: NCBI BLink).";6779069;+;Divergent;Y941;AT5G02540;-937;<1.5kb upstream;chr5;protein_coding;NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein;;"NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein; FUNCTIONS IN: oxidoreductase activity, binding, catalytic activity; INVOLVED IN: oxidation reduction, metabolic process; EXPRESSED IN: 22 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 13 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: NAD(P)-binding domain (InterPro:IPR016040), Glucose/ribitol dehydrogenase (InterPro:IPR002347), Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SDR (InterPro:IPR002198); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein (TAIR:AT2G37540.1); Has 30201 Blast hits to 17322 proteins in 780 species: Archae - 12; Bacteria - 1396; Metazoa - 17338; Fungi - 3422; Plants - 5037; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 2996 (source: NCBI BLink).";567587;+;Divergent;Y942;AT2G18280;-2217;<3kb upstream;chr2;protein_coding;tubby like protein 2;Member of TLP family;"tubby like protein 2 (TLP2); CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: F-box domain, cyclin-like (InterPro:IPR001810), Tubby, C-terminal, conserved site (InterPro:IPR018066), Tubby, C-terminal (InterPro:IPR000007); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: tubby like protein 3 (TAIR:AT2G47900.3); Has 35333 Blast hits to 34131 proteins in 2444 species: Archae - 798; Bacteria - 22429; Metazoa - 974; Fungi - 991; Plants - 531; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 9610 (source: NCBI BLink).";7943782;+;Parallel;Y943;AT5G25190;-1519;<3kb upstream;chr5;protein_coding;Integrase-type DNA-binding superfamily protein;encodes a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-6 of ERF/AP2 transcription factor family.

The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy.

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO6 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO2, AtMLO3 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in root tips and cotyledon vascular system, in floral organs (anthers and stigma), and in fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).;"MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 12 (MLO12); FUNCTIONS IN: calmodulin binding; INVOLVED IN: defense response to fungus, incompatible interaction, response to cyclopentenone, leaf senescence, cell death, defense response; LOCATED IN: plasma membrane; EXPRESSED IN: 16 plant structures; EXPRESSED DURING: 7 growth stages; CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: Mlo-related protein (InterPro:IPR004326); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: Seven transmembrane MLO family protein (TAIR:AT1G11310.1); Has 552 Blast hits to 537 proteins in 59 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 0; Metazoa - 0; Fungi - 2; Plants - 545; Viruses - 0; Other Eukaryotes - 5 (source: NCBI BLink).";16359949;-;Parallel;Y1465;Unassigned (Convergent);49;Exon;chr5;na;na;na;na;4464715;+;Convergent;Convergent1466;AT1G66230;-128;<1.5kb upstream;chr1;protein_coding;myb domain protein 20;Encodes a putative transcription factor (MYB20).;"myb domain protein 20 (MYB20); CONTAINS InterPro DOMAIN/s: SANT, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR001005), Homeodomain-like (InterPro:IPR009057), Myb, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR014778), HTH transcriptional regulator, Myb-type, DNA-binding (InterPro:IPR017930), Homeodomain-related (InterPro:IPR012287), Myb transcription factor (InterPro:IPR015495); BEST Arabidopsis thaliana protein match is: myb domain protein 43 (TAIR:AT5G16600.1); Has 8410 Blast hits to 7811 proteins in 453 species: Archae - 0; Bacteria - 0; Metazoa - 663; Fungi - 296; Plants - 5767; Viruses - 4; Other Eukaryotes - 1680 (source: NCBI BLink).";24677026;+;Parallel;Y1467;AT2G42020;40;Exon;chr2;pre_trna;pre-tRNA;;tRNA-Ser (anticodon: GCT);17538744;-;na;N1468;Unassigned (>5kb upstream);-11919;>5kb upstream;chr3;na;na;na;na;16273822;+;Parallel;Y1469;AT3G17609;-37;<1.5kb upstream;chr3;protein_coding;HY5-homolog;Encodes a homolog of HY5 (HYH).

The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.
